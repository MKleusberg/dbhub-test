Hah, you might think! Got their secret crypto just by doing a simple search
on Github, Google, or whatever! But don't start celebrating just yet. There
is nothing interesting to see here. These certificates and keys are not used
in any publicly available application. They are for local testing purposes
only. Have fun using them in your application as well :)

All passwords - for the CA and for the client - are 'password'.

They have been generated using the in-depth guide here, with one change:

* https://jamielinux.com/docs/openssl-certificate-authority/

The client key (client.key) used by DB4S was generated using DES3 (-des3)
instead of AES256 (-aes256), because the Qt layer complained otherwise. ;)
