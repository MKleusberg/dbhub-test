Hah, you might think! Got their secret crypto just by doing a simple search
on Github, Google, or whatever! But don't start celebrating just yet. There
is nothing interesting to see here. These certificates and keys are not used
in any publicly available application. They are for local testing purposes
only. Have fun using them in your application as well :)

All passwords - for the CA and for the client - are 'password'.

Here are some resources on how to generate them:
